    "# Part 1: Classification with K-means algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a fundamental tool among the unsupervised learning model. Consider a problem with a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{x_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^n$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ with no labels, we are aiming at finding some hidden structure within the data, namely, we would like to find clusters in the dataset. Classifiers have been studied in TP but mainly for supervised learning, here the data are not labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm tries to classify the dataset in $K$ clusters. Each cluster is represented by a centroid, meaning the average of the points within the cluster. We note $C_k$ the set of points of a cluster $k$ and $\\mu_k$ its centroid. Then, the algorithm minimizes the intra-cluster variance, in other words, it tries to reduce the distance between the points of the cluster and the centroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, the algorithm works iteratively in two main steps: \n",
    " - Points are assigned to clusters based on their proximity to existing centroid\n",
    " - Centroids are updated by taking the average of the points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loss function of the problem can be written as:\n",
    "$$J(\\mu_1, ..., \\mu_K) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\, \\lVert x_i - \\mu(i)\\rVert^2 \\; ,$$\n",
    "where $\\mu(i)$ is the centroid of the cluster assignated to $x_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to check the understanding of the choice of this loss function. Does it match the aforementioned rules? Then, could it help to understand if the algorithm converges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionnally, until Question 8, we assume that the clusters $C_k$ are disjoint, especially at initialization. "

    "However, one problem arised with initial Boltzmann Machine (BM) -- like its parent models in statistical physics (as the SK model) -- all the units are interacting through complicated dependencies. For example, if we consider 3 components of $\\mathbf{v}$: $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$, there are trivial interactions such as one modelised by $P(v_1, v_2)$ corresponding to the correlation between the two first components of $\\mathbf{v}$, but there are also none trivial interactions. Indeed, if some term like $P(v_1, v_2 | v_3)$ which suggests that the correlation $x_1$ and $v_2$ depends on $v_3$ and this is clearly none linear.\n",

    "A really ingenious way to overcome this situation is to replace all the tricky interactions between the units $\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ by connections through hidden units $\\mathbf{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$, artifically created. Indeed, correlations between two units $v_1$ and $v_2$ (specially the dependency of their correlations on other units $v_3$, $v_4$,...) can be atrificially replaced by introducing a third unit $h_1$ and considerin only linear correlations between $v_1 \\leftrightarrow h_1$, $h_1 \\leftrightarrow v_2$ and $v_1 \\leftrightarrow v_2$. The units $v_i$ are now called the visible units. This model is the most known version of BMs. \n",

    "While it seems possible to run RBM algorithm, note that the second term in the gradient w.r.t. $\\mathbf{W}$ is computationally expensive due to the intractability of $Z$, the approximation Contrastive Divergence - k is often use. Research what is this approximation, is this approximation enough, why? Explain it with your own words and cite the papers you used for your documentation."

    "Contrastive Divergence (CD) is an approximation used to train an RBM when the true maximum-likelihood gradient is too expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient has the form (for W):\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial \\log p(v)}{\\partial W}=\\mathbb{E}_{p(h\\mid v)}[v h^\\top]-\\mathbb{E}_{p(v,h)}[v h^\\top]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first expectation is easy to compute because $p(h\\mid v)$ factorizes (sigmoid units). The second expectation is difficult because it requires samples from the model equilibrium distribution $p(v,h)$, which usually needs a long MCMC chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum likelihood would need the negative-phase expectation under the true model distribution $p(v,h)$ (equilibrium). CD replaces it by an approximation obtained after k Gibbs steps starting at the data. So it is not exactly the true likelihood gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early in training, the model’s “bad beliefs” are close to the data (starting the chain at the data makes sense) and CD gives a low-variance, cheap learning signal compared to running very long chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model distribution is far from the data or has many separated modes, a few Gibbs steps may not move enough, making the negative phase biased"
